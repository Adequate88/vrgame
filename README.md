# *Intruder*
---
This repository contains the source Unity files for *Intruder*. All files within the `assets` folder are relevant to the structure of the game.

## Overview

In this README we cover the following topics.
- Produced scripts and assets: Created entirely by our team.
- Adapted scripts/assets: Modified from external sources.
- Unmodified scripts/assets: Used as-is.
- Relevant content (scripts, assets, scenes) for each custom feature.

## General Folder Structure

The general structure of our `assets` folder is broken down into the following general structure:
1. Scene folders: one folder for each scene exists. Each of these contains:
  - The scene itself
  - Asset folder containing any objects/meshes from external sources
  - Script folder: containing all relevant scripts
  - Sounds/Audio: relevant sound effects for a scene
  - Materials: If specfic materials were created for the scene they are found here.
  - Prefabs: Any prefabs created for the scene (some of these leak out into other scenes)
2. `Global_Prefabs` folder: contains prefabs common throughout the game.
3. Miscellaneous folders: some folders do not fall into the structure above and are simply left in the assets folder. Some examples are relevant `TextMesh Pro` asset folder or the imported `XR`/`VR` assets.

 - Scenes in Tutorial have images to teach user the movements and buttons - created by getting images and making sprites using the images.

### Unmodified Scripts/Assets:

 - All other assets, except for those mentioned in the previous section are unmodified and taken from the Unity Asset Store.

### Relevant Content (scripts, assets, scenes) for each custom feature.

- Swimming Mechanic: The relevant scripts are `WaterController.cs` and `Swimming.cs`. The relevant objects are the `ocean` and `Swimming` which is found as a child of the XR Origin/Locomotion object.

- Crawling Mechanic:

- Cooking Mechanic: The relevant scripts are `PlaceIngredientsInPot.cs`, `OvenBakingController.cs`, `PotStirManager`, and `PlaceIngredientsInPot.cs`. The cooking mechanic uses functionalities such as grabbing and placing in a `Pot` object, then holding the `Pot` and mixing using a `Spoon` by grabbing the correct `Spoon` and moving it within the `Pot`'s area to "mix" in the ingredients (`Cheese`, `Milk`, `Egg`), to have cake Batter. Step 2 is placing the batter and rotating the knob of the oven and waiting until the cake is complete.

- Hiding Mechanic: The relevant scripts are `HideController.cs` ,`FadeScreen.cs` and `PlayerSafetyState.cs`. For each hiding spot a `SafeZone`, an `ÃˆxitPosition` and a `HiddenPosition` are determined. Each hiding spot also uses the asset `BreathingSound` as well as an individual opening/closing sound for the particular object.
